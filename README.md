# 🌐 Danilo.Dev — Portfolio Website

Welcome to my **personal portfolio** website built with **Laravel**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Alpine.js**, and **Vite**.

It’s a custom-built site to showcase my **full-stack web development skills** through clean code, interactive animations, modern architecture, and a mobile-first approach.

> ⚠️ This repo is not a boilerplate — it’s a professional showcase and digital CV.
